## Get Involved

Before contributing or participating in discussions with the community, you should familiarize yourself with our [Code of Conduct].

* Come join us on our [Discord Server]! *(music artists, designers, developers, and general users welcome!)*

* We are also active in the [Rust Audio Discord Server] where we develop some of the generic backend modules for the [RustyDAW] project. Please keep discussions there about the [RustyDAW] project and not about Meadowlark specifically. *(developers only please)*

* Developers should also take a look at the current [Design Document].

* Meadowlark is currently being used as a testbed for the upcoming [Tuix] GUI library, and we are working close with the developer for the benefit of both projects. If a GUI library written in Rust interests you, please check them out and give them your support!
