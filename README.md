Meadowlark is a FREE and open-source DAW (Digital Audio Workstation) for Linux, Mac and Windows. It aims to be an accessible and powerful recording, composing, editing, sound designing, mixing, and mastering tool for artists around the world, while also being intuitive and customizable.

It is proudly written in the [`Rust`] programming lanugage, allowing for higher stability without compromising on performance.
