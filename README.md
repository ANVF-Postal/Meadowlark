## Get Involved

Come joing us on our [`Discord Server`]! *(music artists, designers, developers, and general users welcome!)*

We also are active in the [`Rust Audio Discord Server`] where we develop some of the generic backend modules for the [`RustyDAW`] project. Please keep discussions there about the [`RustyDAW`] project and not about Meadowlark specifically. *(developers only please)*

Developers should also take a look at the current [`Design Document`].
