//! # Program (State) Layer
//!
//! This layer owns the state of the program.
//!
//! It is solely in charge of mutating this state. The backend layer and the UI
//! layer cannot mutate this state directly (with the exception of some
//! UI-specific state that does not need to be undo-able such as panel or window
//! size). The backend layer indirectly mutates this state by sending events to
//! the program layer, and the ui layer indirectly mutates this state by calling
//! methods on the ProgramState struct which the UI layer owns.
//!
//! The program layer also owns the handle to the audio thread and is in charge
//! of connecting to the system's audio and MIDI devices. It is also in charge
//! of some offline DSP such as resampling audio clips.
